date: 2023-09-25
description:
  "This week's episode is all about revisiting tech's past. A high quality documentary
  showcases TypeScript's cinematic origin story at Microsoft in a similar vein to the
  React documentary. Svelte 5 takes cues from Knockout.js as it teases what devs can
  expect in the next major version release, and Meta attempts to revive the CSS-in-JS
  hype train with its styling library StyleX."
