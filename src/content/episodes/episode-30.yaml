title: Nx’s Project Crystal, Simple Streaming for Astro, and Apple's App-ocalypse
date: 2024-02-19
description:
  If you’re adding a new feature to your project consider naming it something awesome
  like Project Crystal. That’s what Nx did, so we were morally required to cover what
  it actually does. After that we talked about an interesting new streaming utility for
  Astro, and wrapped up with some major Apple drama in the EU.
