  On this episode of Front-End Fire we welcomed special guest Jason Lengstorf to chat about the news 
  with us. We opened with a follow-up discussion of the let versus const debate from last week. 
  Jack made a video (see below for link), and we had a bit of fun talking about the controversy.


  After that we introduced Effect, a library that dubs itself the missing standard library for TypeScript. 
  Effect just had its first stable release, so we discussed what the library does, what sort of apps 
  it works well in, and how in the world they raised over 2 million dollars in VC money.


  Finally, Jason walked us through his latest creative venture: 4 Web Devs 1 App. The concept, 
  as the name implies, is getting four web developers together to build apps using the same technology. 
  The behind the scenes though, involves a full production team, over four terrabytes of files per video, 
  and a ton of logistics.
