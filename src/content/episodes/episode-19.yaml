  After quite a while out of the public spotlight, the XState team is back in the news with the release of version 5. This new version introduces the "actor model" which allows for more complex state machines. Facebook has also open sourced StyleX, the CSS-in-JS library they use internally. And Deno now has a cron job library that allows you to schedule tasks in your Deno applications. Plus, we talk about the new floating editor windows in VS Code, which is a feature that's been a long time coming for many developers.
