title: ReScript 11.0 Takes on TS, RSCs Explained with Donuts, and OpenAI’s GPT Store
date: 2024-01-22
teaser: >
  🍩 What do donuts and React server components have in common? Listen to our
  latest episode to find out! Plus, Rescript 11.0 challenges TypeScript's throne,
  and OpenAI shakes things up with a GPT Store. 🏪
description: >
  In today's episode, we cover the release of ReScript 11.0, a TypeScript language competitor that offers an
  alternative to TS by focusing on a subset of JS instead of the entire JavaScript feature set which equates
  to simpler types, faster compilation, and no type annocations because the types are always inferred.


  We also cover a unique approach to understanding React Server Components (RSCs) through an analogy of donuts, which is
  both highly entertaining and educational. This new addition to the world of articles aimed at helping devs
  understand RSCs spurs extra comment that's been percolating in the broader React community about how complex
  it's getting to learn React and keep adapting to the times. More than a few well known React devs have penned
  open letter and blogs about their discontent with the current state of the framework and its increasingly close
  ties with Vercel amongst other things. Will the complaints fall on deaf ears, or will the peoples' dissent make
  a different remains to be seen.


  And to round out our news recap today: OpenAI takes its next step by opening a GPT Store, so users can find useful
  and popular GPTs developed by partners and the community.
