description: >
  In this episode, we cover the recent announcement that Remix has added support for Vite. It seems nothing can stop Vite's popularity from growing. We also discuss the release of Docusaurus 3.0, a major update to the popular documentation static site generator. And finally, we take a look at Vercel's AI code generator, v0, which has evolved a bit since its initial release. We also muse about the cryptic post the Angular team has made on X: what could this big announcement be? And we also touch on Svelte's continued ascendancy as well, as StackOverflow declares it plans to use Svelte to enhance its UI.
