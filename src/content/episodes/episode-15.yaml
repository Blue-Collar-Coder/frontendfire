title: Remix joins the Vite Train, Docusaurus 3.0, and an Update on Vercel's AI Code Generator v0
date: 2023-11-06
description:
  "In this episode, we cover the recent announcement that Remix has added support for Vite. It seems nothing can
  stop Vite's popularity from growing. We also discuss the release of Docusaurus 3.0, a major update to the popular documentation
  static site generator. And finally, we take a look at Vercel's AI code generator, v0, which has evolved a bit since
  its initial release. We also muse about the cryptic post the Angular team has made on X: what could this big announcement be??
  And we also touch on Svelte's continued ascendancy as well, as StackOverflow declares it plans to use Svelte to enhance
  its UI."
