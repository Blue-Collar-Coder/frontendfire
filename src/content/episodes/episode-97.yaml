  This week both Google and Microsoft held conferences where they announced all the new, great, AI breakthroughs, but there were a few other notable, web dev-focused pieces in between. VS Code announced it will be open sourcing the GitHub Copilot Chat extension, refactoring relevant components into its core codebase, as the next logical step ‚Äúin making VS Code an open source AI editor.‚Äù


  Microsoft has floated a new idea called ‚ÄúNLWeb‚Äù to make it easier for websites to turn themselves into AI apps using an LLM model and their own data. While this sounds interesting, it‚Äôs very early days yet and is not ready for prime time.


  A blog post from Remix creator Ryan Florence leaked earlier this week, and in it, Ryan shares that Remix v3 will move away from using React. The usual criticisms of React are present: overly complex, can‚Äôt use many features without using Next.js, too much reliance on bundlers, and so Remix v3 will be completely new with a focus on a framework that‚Äôs AI friendly and leveraging all the Web APIs available today. We‚Äôll keep you posted as more details become available.


  In our Lightning News section, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says instead of listening to podcasts now, he sends the transcripts to Copilot AI to summarize the content for him. That‚Äôs one way to be more efficient, we suppose. 

  And not to be outdone this week, Anthropic released Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4. Opus 4 is heralded as the best model for sustained performance on complex, long-running tasks and agent workflows, and already getting rave reviews from Cursor, Replit, Block, and other gen-AI platforms. Sonnet 4 is poised to power the new coding agent in GitHub Copilot, Manus, and a handful of other agentic-projects. The real test for a next gen LLM though? If it can successfully play the Pokemon game unaided, and so far, Claude Opus 4 hasn‚Äôt gotten stuck in a dungeon like its predecessors.
