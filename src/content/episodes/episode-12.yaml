title: React Aria Components, Optimized Barrel File Imports, and ActivityPub Support in WordPress
date: 2023-10-16
teaser: >
  🌐 Faster web, here we come! React Aria's unstyled components bring simplicity to design. Next.js is turbocharging
  build times by optimizing barrel file imports. Plus, WordPress sites join the open social web with ActivityPub!
  It's a tech trifecta! 💻⚡️
description: >
  In this episode, we share how the React Aria team has released a new library of unstyled
  components which work seamlessly with vanilla CSS, Tailwind, Styled Components, and more. The
  Next.js team blogged about how they optimized package imports to improve both local dev performance
  and production cold starts through the use of barrel files; a way to group and export modules from a single file.
  WordPress has announced official support for ActivityPub, the plug-in allowing social networks to talk
  across platforms (the "fediverse"). And finally, Node.js 20.6.0 sounds the death knell for the
  immensely popular dotenv package by introducing native support for loading environment variable files.
