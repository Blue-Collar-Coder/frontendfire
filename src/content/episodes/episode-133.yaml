  It’s apparently survey results reason, and the State of React 2025 results are in. As in the past, Next.js continues to dominate as one of the most used frameworks, but TanStack Start is one to watch. Other honorable mentions include: Zustand, Vite, and (most importantly) Front-end Fire tying for fifth place in the podcast section. Thank you, listeners!


  Google has a new proposal called WebMCP, which is a way to define structured tools for agents visiting a site, ensuring they can perform actions with increased speed, reliability, and precision.


  And instead of complicated build processes to convert HTML to markdown for AI agents’ benefit, Cloudflare now offers real-time content conversion when AI systems request pages from any Cloudflare site. That’s pretty great!


  For this week’s Lightning News, TypeScript 6.0 beta is out now, and it’s the last release before the new Go-version becomes the standard in TS 7, and Google Chrome gets a new split tab feature for the many times when side by side tabs are helpful. Honestly, game changer!
