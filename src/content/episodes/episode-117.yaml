  React Conf brought the goods this week 👀: React spins out from Meta into a new foundation, React 19.2 ships new rendering magic, and Cloudflare introduces Cap’n Web (a pure TypeScript RPC). Also... the EU admits cookie banners were a mistake 🍪

  It’s been a big week for React devs as the annual React Conf just wrapped up in Las Vegas. 


  The biggest news? React and React Native are moving out from under Meta to a new React Foundation with an independent technical governance structure. The React Foundation’s mission will be to support the React community and ecosystem, and a board of directors will oversee its continued growth and development in the future.


  Also in time for React Conf, React 19.2 dropped, and it brings new features like partial pre-rendering, a new useEffectEvent hook, and an <Activity/> component that lets devs prioritize rendering different parts of the app to maintain state and make navigation faster.


  Not to be outdone, Cloudflare announced a new RPC protocol called Cap’n Web, which is a pure TypeScript implementation. What makes Cap’n Web unique is that it supports bi-directional calling, promise pipelining, and lets users design RPC interfaces that look like regular JavaScript APIs.


  In Lightning News this week, the makers of the Opera browser just released their own AI-browser Opera Neon, but it comes with a $20/month subscription price tag? And the EU policymakers who forced us all to endure cookie banners on practically every website over a decade ago are finally trying to figure out how to fix the terrible UX monster they created. Good luck to them.
