title: New React Framework Waku, Agile 2 in Action, and Big Updates in Safari 17.2
date: 2023-12-18
description:
  'Today, we discuss the new framework Waku, which is designed to support React Server Components,
  from Daishi Kato (the creator of popular state management libraries Zustand and Jotai). We also delve
  into Agile 2, a new take on agile development because the original Agile Manifesto has, in the words of
  the author, "The Agile experiment was only a partial success: Agile now needs to pivot!" Safari 17.2
  promises a smoother browsing experience with lots of small improvements, and Pantone has announced the
  color of 2024 is "Peach Fuzz." Have you ever wanted to trace your network requests in local development?
  Envy might be just the tool for you. And if you''re looking for a code assistant, Cody AI is here to help.
  Lots of good stuff to cover in this episode!'
