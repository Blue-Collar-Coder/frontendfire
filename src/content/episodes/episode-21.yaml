description: >
  As with many podcasts around this time of year, we're wrapping up the year with predictions for what
  the world of web development will look like in 2024. Before we dive into our predictions,
  we touch on the Adobe Figma merger, which made headlines for falling apart after regulators
  pressured Adobe to abandon the deal citing its near-monopoly in the design software market. Then
  we envision a future with even more native JavaScript APIs, a return to simpler JS frameworks that
  "just work", and AI that's integrated throughout the entire code base. Will our predictions come true?
  Will they be way off the mark? We'll have to wait unitl next year to find out!
