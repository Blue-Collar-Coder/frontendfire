title: Warp Code and the Future of Agent-Driven Dev
date: 2025-09-08
teaser: >
  Warp‚Äôs new Warp Code wants to make your terminal the hub of AI dev workflows ‚ö°, Google walks away from its antitrust case with barely a scratch üëÄ, and Atlassian just dropped $610M to buy AI browser Dia üí∞.
description: >
  The Google vs. the US anti-trust lawsuit has finally drawn to a close, and (spoiler alert) Google doesn‚Äôt have to sell Chrome (or Android, for that matter). Google has to do barely anything, to be honest. Going forward it will have to share certain search data with its rivals, and that‚Äôs about it, so this is definitely a big win for Google any way you look at it.


  The popular terminal company Warp just unveiled Warp Code - a suite of features for shipping agent-generated code ‚Äúall the way from prompt to production‚Äù via the Warp terminal. Warp Code offers an agent-driven terminal-first approach, with visual code review of agent changes, and a native file editor for minor edits in an attempt to eliminate the context switching devs have to do nowadays between their AI agents, IDEs, and GitHub. It‚Äôs certainly another novel approach to the AI coding workflows we‚Äôre all exploring right now.


  In a twist no one saw coming, SaaS behemoth Atlassian has bought AI-browser Dia (and its maker The Browser Company) for $610 million. Atlassian wants to position Dia as the AI-browser for users at work and time will tell if that bet pays off.


  Continuing the staggering funding numbers in our Lightning News, Anthropic has raised another $13 billion in Series F funding after growing its run rate revenue from $1 billion at the beginning of 2025 to $5 billion by August of 2025. ChatGPT may be winning the personal use market, but Anthropic is definitely winning the tech and enterprise use market. 


  And on the heels of that, OpenAI teased that it is building an AI-powered hiring platform to rival LinkedIn. It‚Äôs an odd move considering how Microsoft is heavily invested in OpenAI and also owns LinkedIn, so we‚Äôll have to wait and see how that plays out in mid-2026.
