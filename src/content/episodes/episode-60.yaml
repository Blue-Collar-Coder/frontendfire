  This edition of the podcast rounds up a bunch of interesting news-worthy topics in the web development world for your listening pleasure.


  Kicking off the discussion is the release of Vue 3.5. Although it’s not a major release, Vue 3.5 packs some great new features and 
  optimizations like: reactivity system improvements (up to 56% less memory usage for apps than before), reactive prop destructuring stabilization 
  (it’s simpler to declare props with default values), and SSR improvements like lazy hydration for async components. The Vue-ture looks bright 
  for this framework that doesn’t get as much press as the Reacts, Sveltes, and Angulars of the world.


  RedwoodJS is also out with a new version, and 8.0 packs a wallop. It makes RedwoodJS the third framework to support React Server Components 
  behind Next.js and Waku. Other highlights include background jobs for tasks that can be done behind the scenes, Storybook using Vite, Docker 
  support, and more.


  The shadcn CLI has gotten an update as well where it can spin up a brand new Next.js app with shadcn and Tailwind configured and ready to go. 
  Additionally, shadcn has integrated more tightly with Vercel’s v0 AI code generator, and now every shadcn component is editable on v0, so 
  users can customize the components in natural language and paste it into their apps afterwards. Pretty amazing!


  The TC39 Committee responsible for evaluating what new features get added to the JavaScript language has added a new intermediate step for proposals: 
  step 2.7. By the time new proposals reach step 3, they must already have full test suites to support their implementation, and if, for any reason, 
  they must go back to step 2 to rethink things, a lot of that work can be for naught. Step 2.7 aims to give proposers a chance to begin getting 
  community feedback before the test suites are fully written, just in case things end up needing additional consideration.


  Following up on the SSR benchmark wars covered in the last episode, the team notes that the original writer who did the benchmarking was not an 
  impartial, third party observer, but a lead maintainer for the Fastify framework, which happened to be crowned the fastest SSR framework as well. 
  This serves as a good reminder to always do your homework on who is authoring these sorts of comparisons and where their loyalties might lie.


  And last but not least, Laravel, a PHP framework originally released in 2011, just announced $57M of series A funding. Where is all this funding 
  going? To support Laravel Cloud, a fully managed infrastructure platform focused specifically on Laravel and PHP apps. It just goes to show that 
  even established and well loved frameworks like Laravel can find ways to improve the developer experience even now with a little extra funding and 
  support.
