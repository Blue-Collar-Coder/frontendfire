title: Is es-toolkit the Lodash Killer?
date: 2025-08-04
teaser: >
  This week on the pod: ‚öîÔ∏è es-toolkit aims to dethrone Lodash, üß† oRPC wants to up your API game, üìâ Stack Overflow‚Äôs 2024 dev survey is out ‚Äî and it‚Äôs not pretty üéß. We unpack all that and more.
description: >
  There‚Äôs a new utility library in town called es-toolkit, and it‚Äôs gunning for Lodash. 2-3x faster, 97% smaller, full TypeScript support, and using modern JavaScript APIs, es-toolkit‚Äôs just added a ‚ÄúLodash compatibility layer‚Äù to ensure an identical API and 100% Lodash compatibility. Watch your back, Lodash; your reign may be over.


  oRPC is the newest wrinkle in the Remote Procedural Call (RPC) world, and it promotes easy to build APIs that are end-to-end type-safe and adhere to OpenAPI standards. OpenAPI is a standard for defining APIs that‚Äôs long been useful for generating API SDKs, Postman collections, Swagger UIs, and more, and now oRPC combines the goodness of type-safe APIs with the benefits of the popular OpenAPI standards.


  Stack Overflow‚Äôs 15th developer survey results are in, and the learnings are... interesting. Some of the takeaways are expected (React‚Äôs still very popular, lots of devs have at least tried AI tools), but some seem willfully wrong (SO claims it‚Äôs a new resource for devs that need to solve AI-related issues, but 43% of respondents said they rarely or never visit the site anymore). Either way, SO‚Äôs use has declined dramatically over the last few years due to the rise of AI, and we‚Äôll see how much longer it can hang on as a vital part of the developer ecosystem.


  For Lightning News this week, bolt.new shared the winners of its month-long, vibe coding hackathon, Microsoft Edge launches its experimental Copilot Mode (another AI-agent enabled browser), and the State of HTML survey is live now.
