  GitHub, Next.js and Prettier are all in the news this week! GitHub Copilot Chat takes center stage
  when it's announced it's coming to github.com. Next.js release partial prerendering as an
  experimental feature to speed up sites by pre-rendering static portions of a route and only
  streaming in the dynamic parts needed in a single HTTP request. And the Prettier team offers up
  a $20,000 bounty to anyone who can rewrite the popular code formatter in Rust. Who do you
  think will take home that prize? It remains to be seen, but get ready to work faster and smarter.
