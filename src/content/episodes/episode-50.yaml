  üé• Ever wondered what a reality TV coding show would look like? Jack shares his experience on 
  an episode of "Learn with Jason‚Äù! ü§ñ Perplexity faces backlash for ignoring robots.txt 
  files while training AI models. üçè Apple under fire again for EU Digital Markets Act violations.

  In a rare turn of events, it was a slightly quieter week in terms of actual web development 
  news, so the hosts round up some technology-adjacent news and drama to share.


  Jack kicks off the show recounting his experience of being one of four developers in a reality 
  show-type scenario that his friend Jason Lengstorf (host of the YouTube show ‚ÄúLearn with Jason‚Äù) 
  put together. The four competitors had about 4 hours to build something unique using a 
  vector database while cameras rolled and producers asked questions in one-on-ones outside the studio. 
  The episode, which is out now, was a blast to participate in, and makes for some quality code viewing. 
  Maybe Jason‚Äôs found a new niche in the web development video world: reality TV coding??


  Next up is more drama around how AI companies are training their LLMs. Up and coming AI company 
  Perplexity‚Äôs getting some heat for ignoring the robots.txt files on websites banning AI companies 
  from crawling the content to teach their models. While there‚Äôs no legal ramifications (yet) for 
  companies who ignore these instructions, reputable companies have respected the Robots Exclusion Protocol 
  since they came into use in the ‚Äò90s.


  And Apple is once more accused of violating the EU‚Äôs Digital Markets Act in regards to its lackluster 
  support for alternative iOS marketplaces in Europe. In retaliation, Apple has announced it will delay rolling 
  out some of the cornerstone iOS 18 features to European users due to ‚Äúinteroperability requirements that could 
  undermine user privacy and data security.‚Äù


  Finally, TypeScript 5.5, previously in beta stage (in episode 42), has now reached release candidate stage. 
  It brings with it inferred type predicates, regex syntax checking, and 33% smaller package size.
