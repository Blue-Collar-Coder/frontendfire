title: WordPress Wars Continue, React Server Functions, and Web Component Backlash
date: 2024-10-07
teaser: >
  üî• WP Engine is taking WordPress to court, and it‚Äôs getting ugly! üìú React 19‚Äôs Server Actions are now called‚Ä¶ Server Functions? ü§î And JS framework 
  creators speak out against the state of Web Components and SSR. Is it innovation or just friction? üîÑ

  WP Engine is taking Automattic and Matt Mullenweg to court. The complaints are numerous and juicy: extortion, libel, slander, and include screenshots 
  of text messages, tweets, and emails that look pretty damning against Automattic. The whole story has ‚ÄúMade for TV documentary‚Äù written all over it.


  In slightly less controversial news, React 19 has renamed its Server Actions to Server Functions. This name change brings React‚Äôs server functions more 
  in line with other frameworks who support the same sort of functionality like SolidJS, Astro, TanStack Start, and others.


  Also in a follow up from the last episode where we talked about a new addition to the Web Components world allowing for web components with SSR via the 
  Declarative Shadow DOM, a good number of JavaScript framework creators shared their misgivings about the creation of Web Components. Ryan Carniato and 
  Rich Harris were two of the most vocal, and basically said WCs have made their work writing frameworks harder, not easier, and WCs are not the future.


  Our Fire Starter for today is a blast from the past: the marquee HTML element. For the youngsters out there, the marquee element existed since the 
  earliest days of the web and was used to insert a scrolling area of text. It presented many accessibility issues, and has since been deprecated in 
  favor of better ways to animate elements but it still exists in the wild. Check out the example in the MDN docs if you want, but don‚Äôt subject anyone to it.
