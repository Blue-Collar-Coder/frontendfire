title: Exploring Next-Gen Web Components, New Code Hike Highlighter, and Apple Vision
date: 2024-01-29
description:
  'In this episode, we dive into the new web component features from the W3C like the declarative Shadow DOM gaining 
  full cross-browser support as of Firefox 123, scoped element registries allowing for multiple custom element 
  definitions within a single tag name, and CSS style queries that let you query a CSS property for a container 
  and style the child based on it. Startup Code Hike joins the syntax highlighting race with a new code highlighter 
  that takes it to a whole other level, offering things like focus within a code block, spotlighting a line of code,
  and more. It's got some very slick features that make it worth checking out. We discuss the release this week of
  the Apple Vision Pro headset, its hefty initial price tag of $3,500, and if Apple will be the one to finally make 
  "spatial computing" mainstream. And we wrap up the episode with a footnote about Bun Shell, a new experimental feature 
  from the Bun team to make running shell scripts in JavaScript and TypeScript code less of a pain.''
