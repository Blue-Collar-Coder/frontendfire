  Hono is a framework with a cool logo, cool name, and a cool new release
  that we discuss in detail. Next, we talk about Storybook 8, which has some
  exciting new support for React server components. Finally, we wrap up with an
  update on Apple breaking PWAs in the EU. (Hint: If you think it is good news,
