  Want to keep up with frontend development news fast? Check out the new Front-end Fire podcast with hosts Jack Herrington, TJ VanToll, and Paige Niedringhaus where we cover three frontend news topics each week! We'll even bring on a guest now and again to talk about new releases!
description: >
  In our very first episode, we introduce ourselves to listeners, and dive right into the latest news in the web development world. Dan Abramov shocks the React community by announcing his departure from Meta and the React core team. That segues into GitHub Copilot Chat being released for enterprise dev teams, and finally, Astro's zero-JavaScript page transitions. There's rarely a dull moment when it comes to new in the web dev world!
