  The field of AI coding agent CLIs is crowded and getting more so by the day, and our co-host Jack has tried them all so you donâ€™t have to. The big four are: OpenAIâ€™s Codex, Anthropicâ€™s Claude Code, Googleâ€™s Gemini Code, and Amazon Q, along with some lesser known CLIs like AmpCode, OpenCode, and (the already shut down) Anon Kode. After trying everything, Jack says Anthropicâ€™s Sonnet models and Claude Code are still the best when it comes to working code, so if youâ€™re already using Claude, stick with it.


  Googleâ€™s quietly been working on new LLM-powered web APIs that rely on Googleâ€™s Gemini Nano model to power browser features like language detection and translation, and writing and proofreading, and Mozilla is concerned. Googleâ€™s decision to base these APIs on Gemini Nano in Chrome means devs will create apps based on Geminiâ€™s behavior, which might behave differently in a different browser with a different model, Mozilla says.


  Less than two months after Figmaâ€™s big Config conference where it announced Figma Sites and Figma Make, Figma shared that it has acquired OS headless CMS Payload. Continuing the effort to make Figma a central hub for digital product creation, Figmaâ€™s adding a CMS to the mix so marketers and designers can more easily update website content as needed. Payload will remain open source for now, and weâ€™ll let you know of new features as Figma brings it into the fold.


  In Lightning News, Firefox v140 dropped and brought the option to have vertical tabs with it. Jack shared a cautionary tale of how upgrading to the new Mac OS 26 too soon caused his laptop to slowly fail until he had to finally roll back to an older OS version. And Anthropicâ€™s in hot water, not for cutting millions of print books from their bindings to scan into digital files for training data and throwing away the originals, but for previously using pirated books to train its models to avoid licensing negotiations with publishers prior to 2024. No word yet on this will end, but itâ€™s certainly not a good look for the company.
