teaser: >
  🎧 Ever wondered what tech gear actual developers can't live without? This episode has it all—from monitors to microphones. No sponsorships, just honest opinions! 🖥️ What can't you live without in your workspace? 💬
description: >
  The hosts switch up the regular news format this week in favor of another favorite developer topic: tech gear. All the extras that make web development that little bit nicer.


  If you were stranded on a desert island (that only had power and Internet), what tech gear would you bring that you just can’t live without?


  Aside from MacBook Pros for all three hosts, there’s a good variety of office chairs, adjustable desks, external monitors, keyboards, mice, headphones, microphones, and even cameras. Many of the recognizable brand names make an appearance like: Apple, Logitech, Elgato, Microsoft, Steelcase, and Shure.


  If you’ve ever wanted recommendations from folks actively using these products (and not getting sponsored to endorse them) then this is the episode for you.


  And of course, we want to know what you use as well, so join us in the Discord to share your own workspace setups, the gear you can’t live without, and anything else you want to talk about.
