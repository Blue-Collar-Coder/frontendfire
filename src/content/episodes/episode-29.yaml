description:
  "The early trend of 2024 seems to be browser initiatives, with Amazon announcing their new JavaScript runtime, LLRT
  (low latency runtime), an experimental, lightweight JS runtime designed to address the growing demand for fast and
  efficient serverless applications.\n

  Vite 5.1 is also released, with a new experimental runtime VPI, improved support for CSS files as URLs, 
  better performance, and more.\n 
  
  Interop 2024 just wrapped up, and 16 new initiatives were chosen by the major browser engine teamss, 
  including focus areas of accessibility, popovers, CSS nesting, and - something web
  developers have wanted since CSS was a thing - scrollbar styling! If you're interested to see how the various browsers
  stack up against one another, there's a handy web platform tests site dashboard that shows which tests each browser passed
  and failed of the 1.8M tests WPT has created so far.\n 
  
  We also touch on the React Native visionOS that the Callstack team released in record time after the Apple Vision Pro's 
  debut, specifically for building native visionOS apps, and tip our hat to jQuery for release jQuery v4, a mere 8 
  years after jQuery 3 debuted. Kudos to the team for sticking with it.\n 
  
  Last but not least, the team behind Million.js teases their newest offering Million Lint, an IDE extension designed to help
  identify and fix slow React components. Details are still scarce, but we're excited to see what they come up with, and will
  be sure to update you as we learn more."
