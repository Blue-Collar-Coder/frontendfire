title: Astro Adds Databases, Pigment CSS, and Speedometer 3.0 Browser Testing
date: 2024-03-18
description:
  In this episode, we explore the latest in web development with Astro unveiling Astro DB,
  a fully managed, blazing fast SQL-based database that is “ridiculously easy to use.”
  Next, you may not know the name, but Speedometer just released version 3.0, which further
  solidifies its status as the browser benchmark for web app responsiveness. Next up is
  Pigment CSS, a zero-runtime CSS-in-JS solution from the makers of the Material UI component
  library that works with Next.js’ app router and React Server Components. And to cap it all
  off, we’ve got new details about Rolldown, the Rust-based version of Rollup, and Chris
  Coyier’s honest thoughts about what happened to his CSS Tricks site after it was acquired.
