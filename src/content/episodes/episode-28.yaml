description:
  'Three thought leaders in the React community join us on the podcast today for a very special
  episode where we dive into what is being dubbed "the two Reacts". Rachel Nabors, formerly
  of React at Meta known for their work on reactnative.dev and react.dev, Evan Bacon,
  Engineering Manager at Expo, and Matt Carroll, Developer Advocate React at Meta, share their
  thoughts on the current feelings in the React community that are essentially "two Reacts":
  client side React and server side React. As React swings more and more towards doing work on the
  server, where does that leave React Native? Is it the last bastion of frontend dev? The group
  discusses the lack of options for service providers that provide a "first class React experience"
  (i.e. Vercel and Next.js being the only real options support React Server Components at the moment),
  and debate if RSCs should have been baked into the React core library. From documentation
  challenges, to the possibilities of forming a new React working group and getting more widespread
  adoption of RSCs amongst other React frameworks, to where React goes from here, the group
  covers a lot of ground in a very thoughtful manner. This is a must-listen for developers seeking
  a clearer path in React.'
