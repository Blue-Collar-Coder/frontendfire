date: 2023-10-23
description:
  With Jack away on assignment, TJ and Paige hold down the fort for this episode
  of Front-end Fire. In it, they discuss the release of TanStack Query v5 which
  brings a ton of new features including simplified optimistic updates, first
  class suspense support, a brand new Devtools, and more. They also talk about the
  new support for Dev Containers in CodeSandbox, a feature that allows users to set
  up a full-featured dev environment in the cloud using a single configuration file.
  Imagine using the same dev container to spin up a dev environment locally or on
  any supporting cloud tool for a standardized development experience. The future is truly now.
