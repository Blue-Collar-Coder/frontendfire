  Vanilla JS author Chris Ferdinandi joins the podcast this week to talk about how having 
  ADHD has affected his career in web development.


  Chris shares his own diagnosis of ADHD as a child, then proceeds to discuss how it can be 
  both a positive and a negative depending on the situation and how different individuals 
  can have ADHD to varying degrees. 


  He covers strategies heâ€™s developed over the years to be most effective at his job; things 
  like sending follow up emails after meetings with lists of deliverables or blocking off chunks 
  of time on the calendar during the workday for focus work like coding. And he also makes 
  recommendations for coworkers or managers of neurodivergent folks on how to support them 
  so they can do their best work. Finally, he offers advice for listeners who may relate to 
  many of the symptoms described during the show, and what they can do if they want to learn 
  more about getting diagnosed.


  Itâ€™s a very enlightening episode, and fascinating to hear about the progress being made in the 
  field of ADHD as well as the growing destigmatization around the diagnosis: many listeners may 
  even pick up tips to help them manage their own work days better after listening in.
