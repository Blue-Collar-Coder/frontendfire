  On this week‚Äôs episode, a new software licensing term has emerged in the development world: Fair Source Software (FSS). 


  The error and exception tracking software company Sentry added some legal protections to their Codecov product last year 
  (they are a business trying to earn money, after all), which technically meant it was no longer open source. In order to 
  keep sharing its code with the community, Sentry created a new ‚ÄúFair Source‚Äù licensing category that shares similar values 
  to open source, but also allows companies to enforce non-compete clauses to protect its business interests.


  The fact that other companies like GitButler, Keygen, CodeCrafters, and more have already joined the Fair Source site is an 
  indication that this sort of ‚Äúalmost open source‚Äù licensing could be appealing to companies who‚Äôve wanted to share their code 
  with the world, but worried it could negatively impact their ability to stay in business. Time will tell, but good on Sentry 
  for taking the first step.


  In other news, even though the React Native framework is already 10 years old, the team just launched v0.75. While this isn‚Äôt 
  a major release, it lays the groundwork for v1 by reporting that the ‚Äúnew architecture‚Äù required for support of new React 18+ 
  features like Suspense, synchronous layouts, and concurrent rendering is now stable. Additionally, the latest version of RN‚Äôs 
  embeddable layout system Yoga now handles % values in gaps and translations, which is a nice bonus. We don‚Äôt know exactly when 
  RN v1 will be out, but you can bet it‚Äôs going to be good.
