  üî• Attention devs! Google introduces Jpegli, a new JPEG coding library. üéâ Online code
  platform Val Town raises $5.5M to run serverless functions in the browser, and
  Jack Herrington‚Äôs latest creation Declarative Routing, aims to make Next.js
  routes easier than ever. üõ†Ô∏è

  "The group dives into the week‚Äôs news right away, starting off with a new open source
  project from Google called Jpegli. Jpepgli is a new JPEG coding library, which claims
  to compress images up to 35% smaller while also being able to deliver JPEGs in even
  higher quality than what is currently available today. The GitHub repo the article links
  to still looks to be in the early stages of development, but this could be a new
  solution for JPEGs, which traditionally can take quite a bit to load in the browser
  depending on their size and resolution.\n

  The next topic for discussion is a company called Val Town that‚Äôs raised $5.5M in funding.
  The premise is that users can write small snippets of code in Val Town‚Äôs online platform
  and Val Town will run them in serverless functions and do things like send HTTP requests,
  run scheduled cron jobs, send emails, and users of the platform can see the ‚Äúvals‚Äù and comment
  on them, like them, etc. It remains to be seen how much traction this will generate in the
  web development world, but it seems like an interesting concept lowering the barrier to entry
  for folks who aren‚Äôt coding professionals.\n

  Jack shares his new declarative routing library for Next.js as another interesting bit of
  news for the week. Type safe routing in packages like React Router and Tanstack Router are
  becoming the preferred method of writing routes, but it‚Äôs still a very manual process without
  a lot of autocompletion and input validation that we‚Äôve come to expect in TypeScript code today,
  and the Declarative Routing library aims to bring that same level of comfort and coding niceties
  to routes in Next.js. It‚Äôs also OSS, so if you‚Äôre interested in contributing to open source,
  check it out!\n

  Finally, Cloudflare made the announcement that they‚Äôve acquired OSS platform PartyKit.
  PartyKit, started by former Cloudflare employee Sunil Pai, is focused on making real-time,
  collaborative, multiplayer functionality within apps easy. It handles that aspect through
  the use of Cloudflare Durable Objects and Cloudflare Workers, so that developers can focus on
  the logic that makes their apps unique, and it seems like a well-made match to bring PartyKit
  under the official Cloudflare umbrella. The future roadmap is focused on integrations with
  popular frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular, so expect to hear more about this in the future."
