title: Wangular, RedwoodJS on the RSC Bandwagon, Modern CSS
date: 2024-04-01
description:
  It turns out we had a lot of news to cover in this week’s episode. We kicked it off
  discussing how RedwoodJS is the latest framework to support React Server Components,
  and has some pretty nice illustrated docs to help devs get started. Then, there was a
  rapid fire of interesting topics including a great new article about modern CSS from
  Mr. CSS Tricks himself, Chris Coyier, a new documentary film on the origin story of
  Node.js from the team that created the React and Ruby on Rails documentaries as well,
  and a footnote about a new antitrust case the US Department of Justice has leveraged
  against Apple. At NG Conf earlier in the week, it was announced Google’s internal
  framework Wiz might be combining with Angular after the two teams successfully worked
  together to launch Angular signals primitives for 100% of YouTube’s mobile web traffic
  to great effect. We can only hope the resulting combined framework is renamed to Wangular.
  And to round it all out, yet another CSS framework has popped up claiming to have all
  the answers to the ever pervasive feeling that CSS is hard. Will Nue CSS have the good
  to back up its claim? We’ll have to wait and see, and give the new Promise.withResolvers
  a spin in the meantime.
