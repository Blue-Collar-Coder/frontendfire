  We first reported on Evan You‚Äôs company void0 back in October, 2024, and now Evan and co are making good on their promise to rework the entire JS toolchain from the ground up with the release of Rolldown-Vite. The new package is a drop-in replacement for the Vite bundler we all know and love, with benefits like production build time reductions of up to 16x and memory usage decreases of up to 100x. Replacement is easy and the perf gains are real. Try it today.


  Apple just held WWDC25 and announced big updates in Safari 26 beta. Favicons get replaced with SVG icons, any website can be a web app on iOS and iPadOS, there‚Äôs a brand new HTML <model> element for visionOS, CSS anchor positioning for popovers is supported as well as scroll-driven animations, and much more. Suffice it to say, Safari‚Äôs got some slick new features under the hood. The jury is still very much out on the gooey, glassmorphic UI design that Apple also unveiled at WWDC, however.


  The Browser Company, who made the niche, but well liked Arc browser, has been working on a new AI-first browser called Dia, and this week it‚Äôs available early access for Arc Members. At first glance Dia feels similar to other ‚Äúagentic‚Äù browsers, giving users a chat input and the ability to chat about content in tabs or links, but it also shows off skills like connecting to calendars to schedule meetings or composing text that can be inserted into emails. We‚Äôll report back after we‚Äôve had a chance to test Dia out for a bit.


  This week‚Äôs Lightning News is about AI-coding IDE Cursor who‚Äôs raised a whopping $900 million in Series C funding, and shares that Cursor has grown to over $500 million in ARR (annual recurring revenue). We don‚Äôt know how much of that is profit, but the numbers around AI startups continue to be absolutely staggering.
