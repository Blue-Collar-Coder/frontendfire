  It’s been 4 years since TypeScript schema validation library Zod released v3, but the new v4 release makes it worth the wait. Expect faster parsing times across the board, built in error pretty-printing, and even a tree-shakeable API called Zod Mini for constrained environments like edge runtimes.


  There’s a new npm-based CLI tool for managing and sharing AI rules across different editors and tools called vibe-rules. In addition to saving favorite prompts so they can be applied to any supported editor, vibe-rules can also automatically install prompts shared in a project’s NPM packages into an editor’s configuration. It’s early days yet, but a great idea to make prompts easier for anyone to use.


  Angular v20 is out with some much anticipated highlights. Stabilized signal-based APIs, incremental hydration, custom Angular reporting directly in Chrome DevTools, GenAI development advancements, and, last but not least, a RFC for an official Angular mascot. Not to bias you, but we favor the pink, dice-shaped mascot around here.


  In Lightning News, Remix continues to make waves with its official blog release stating Remix v3 won’t use React. StackOverflow’s 15th annual developer survey is out now - you should vote for us in the podcast section. Firefox becomes the first browser to support the Temporal API: a better way to handle dates. And the month-long bolt.new hackathon kicks off with over 50,000 developers signed up to compete. Judging a hackathon of this size is going to be a challenge all by itself.
