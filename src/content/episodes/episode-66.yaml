title: One Framework, Astro Server Islands, and WordPress Steals a WP Engine Plugin
date: 2024-10-21
teaser: >
  üé± Meet One, a new Vite-powered framework to unify React web and React Native dev. üå† Astro‚Äôs Server Islands offer a refined way to handle server data. üî• And 
  WordPress strikes again, taking control of WP Engine‚Äôs plugin and rebranding it as their own. üò≤ Is this public safety or a power move? Hear the latest in the drama! üéôÔ∏è
description: >
  In the new frameworks based on React, we introduce you to One. It is a Vite-powered project claiming to support React web apps and React Native apps all in one. 
  Built by the Tamagui team (a React OSS UI kit and design system), One boasts universal, typed routing, offline support, and a partnership with Zero, a 
  ‚Äúgeneral purpose sync engine for the web‚Äù, to give users a default data storage solution from the start. 


  Host Jack Herrington shares an update on how Astro‚Äôs Server Islands work after trying them out for himself. Similar to React‚Äôs Suspense components, Astro‚Äôs Server 
  Islands allow any component that relies on server data to render with a ‚Äúfallback‚Äù (like a loader or skeleton component) in the browser until the data is returned 
  and the full HTML can render.


  As we cannot go a week without talking about the latest WordPress and WP Engine drama (listen to our last 3 episodes for full details), the latest kerfuffle involves 
  WordPress seizing control of one of WP Engine‚Äôs most popular plugins hosted on the WordPress Plugin Directory and pushing a forked version of the plugin that WordPress 
  is in control of under the same name. So WP Engine‚Äôs Advanced Custom Fields Plugin is now WordPress‚Äôs Secure Custom Fields plugin under the same URL ‚Äúin the name of 
  public safety‚Äù, according to WordPress founder Matt Mullenweg.


  For extra news: both Express and Zustand debuted v5 this week. Neither comes with major upgrades despite the jump in version number, but rather lots of under-the-hood 
  work to be more modern and ready for the future of JavaScript. And Google has signed a first-of-its-kind deal to purchase nuclear energy for its data centers. AI 
  computing needs lots of power, and AWS and Microsoft are also looking to use nuclear power to meet these needs. What could go wrong?


  Our Fire Starter for the week is the humble <blockquote> element. Around since the earliest days of the Internet the blockquote is meant to highlight enclosed text in an 
  extended quotation, and offers such attributes as cite (for proper URL source citing). Now you know a little more about the blockquote.
