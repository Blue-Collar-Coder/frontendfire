  AI is the name of the game for today‚Äôs episode. ü§ñ As OpenAI's new ‚Äústructured outputs‚Äù feature 
  is a game-changer for devs, the EU is pioneering AI safety with legislation! ‚öñÔ∏è React 19 is on hold a bit longer, 
  and did you ever wonder about CSS usage stats on the Internet? üìä Turns out Chrome‚Äôs got the answers.

  AI is the main topic of conversation for this week‚Äôs episode. Between continued advancements in the 
  technology and governments trying to put safeguards in place to prevent a Terminator-style future, there‚Äôs 
  plenty going on.


  OpenAI has introduced a new feature of its API called ‚Äústructured outputs,‚Äù which essentially lets developers 
  pass in a valid JSON schema that guarantees the model will always generate responses that adhere to it. No 
  omission of required keys, no extra values you weren‚Äôt expecting, no need for strongly worded prompts to 
  achieve consistent formatting. Basically, you can more confidently rely on OpenAI JSON responses to include 
  all the data you want, every time, with Structured Outputs.


  On the flip side, the European Union has introduced the first legislation to develop safe and trustworthy 
  AI within its borders. This legislation includes a 4 tier risk classification system for all AI products 
  ranging from minimal risk to unacceptable risk, and a 3+ year timeline for companies developing AI products 
  to comply with these new regulations. While it sounds good in theory, oversight and enforcement is going to be 
  tough, and these sorts of restrictions may cause an AI drain in Europe as companies and developers looking to 
  build products without so much government bureaucracy leave in favor of more AI-friendly locations.


  The React core team announces the changes to Suspense will delay the release of React 19 for a bit longer than 
  originally planned, but should ultimately lead to a better end user experience for devs and library authors alike.


  And the news rounds out with a game of ‚Äúguess the CSS usage statistics‚Äù compiled by Chrome‚Äôs anonymous usage statistics. 
  Ever wondered what percentage of websites are styling scrollbars, or how many set height? Not to mention the amount 
  of CSS properties we‚Äôve never heard of before: font-synthesis-small-caps, anyone? It‚Äôs quite an eye opening list to 
  peruse, especially for all the obscure properties that are being used by a small fraction of a percent of the web.
