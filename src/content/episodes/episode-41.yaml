title: Node 22, Hydrogen gets Remix(ed), and Vercel Backs Away from the Edge
date: 2024-04-29
teaser: >
  üéâ Shopify's Hydrogen framework is getting a power-up thanks to a boost from Remix, Node.js 
  v22 has landed üöÄ with some exciting new features, and üîÑ Vercel shifts back to rendering via 
  Node after exploring the edge. We discuss all that and more in this latest episode.

  There‚Äôs rarely a dull moment in the web development world and this week is no exception to that rule. 


  The episode kicks off with an update on Shopify‚Äôs meta framework Hydrogen, which is now built on top 
  of the open source framework, Remix, which Shopify acquired back in October of 2022. Hydrogen now has 
  full Vite support and integration with the Vite plugins ecosystem, an overhaul of its SEO (now powered 
  by Remix), full page caching, and a decrease in the CLI bundle size of 60%. Listeners may wonder why 
  Shopify continues to develop both Hydrogen and Remix, and the general thought is that Hydrogen is 
  targeted specifically to bigger ecommerce companies that need modern routing, data fetching, SSR, and 
  easy to work with Shopify APIs.


  Node.js also released its latest version this month, and we‚Äôve already reached v22. Amongst the improvements 
  this version boasts, the most exciting one is probably the support for ESM through an experimental flag, 
  which will eventually become the default. Long live ESM.


  In a surprising reversal of course, Vercel announced it‚Äôs reverting all edge rendering back to Node.js. 
  Vercel first acknowledges it had too many different ‚ÄúEdge‚Äù products, which made it hard for developers to keep 
  straight, but then also it became apparent that even when running a site itself ‚Äúon the edge‚Äù, if the site needed 
  to access a database, it most likely had to go back to a region farther away to fetch the data. Turns out, using 
  Vercel‚Äôs original Node.js runtime resulted in faster startups, cheaper costs, and better security than edge 
  functions. Who knew?? 


  Today‚Äôs episode winds down with a few extra interesting bits of news: the FTC has announced a new rule to ban non compete 
  agreements in the US, and a new feature from the popular React component collection shadcn called ‚ÄúLift Mode‚Äù. 
  ‚ÄúLift Mode‚Äù essentially lets users pick and choose what code to copy from one of shadcn‚Äôs ‚Äúblocks‚Äù (pre-made collections 
  of components) for use in their own project. Pretty cool!
