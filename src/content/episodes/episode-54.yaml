  Web development survey results season is upon us, so this weekâ€™s episode covers two of the newly released 
  survey results: the State of React survey 2023 and Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024.


  Just over 13,000 developers filled out the State of React survey, and the results were quite interesting. 
  React devs are fans of component libraries like MUI (Material UI) and shadc/n, state management libraries 
  like Zustand, and data fetching libraries like TanStack Query. They gripe about well-known Hook footguns 
  like useEffect(), useMemo(), and useCallback(). And features like React Server Components and the use() 
  Hook are still largely untested by the community, although many devs have heard of them.


  The more all encompassing development survey from Stack Overflow received 65,000 responses this year, 
  providing some very cool insights about the larger developer world beyond the bounds of React. Overall 
  use of AI technologies like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot is already quite high among devs, PostgreSQL continues 
  to be the most popular database for the second year in a row, devs whoâ€™ve used Svelte in the past want to 
  keep working with it in the future, and although JavaScript, Python, and SQL are all highly used languages, 
  Rust continues to be the most admired programming language of the year.


  Itâ€™s fascinating to watch the trends starting to catch on or die down in the web development space year over 
  year, and we highly encourage everyone to take a look at the survey results. There will probably be some 
  surprises in store.
