  CSS wizard, and now Staff Design Engineer at Shopify, Adam Argyle, joins us on this episode to talk about what web development interviews are like in 2025 and what folks can do to stand out today.


  Adam shares how many rejections he received despite big tech names on his resume and internal referrals, to help other devs know itâ€™s not just them. He then shares tips he developed like tightening up his elevator pitch and making a sizzle reel of cool projects to show off his skills.


  Once heâ€™d gotten companiesâ€™ attention, he discussed the interview processes (spoiler alert: itâ€™s still pretty broken), and which companies took a different approach to let him show his stuff instead of just trying to tick items off a checklist.


  Finally, Adam shared some general advice for all the job seekers to act excited to be interviewing with the company, double check any slides and links before presenting, and be open to redoing things youâ€™ve built before: version 2 will always be an improvement over version 1. 


  Itâ€™s hard not to feel excited and encouraged when talking to Adam, and we hope you get some useful takeaways from this episode, regardless of your current job status.
