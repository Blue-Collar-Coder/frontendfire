date: 2023-10-02
description:
  "We knew it was only a matter of time before ChatGPT made its way fully into the JavaScript
  ecosystem, and this week it finally happened: introducing ChatGPT.js! Plus, the Nx team
  is back with some exciting updates for large-scale monorepos, including a new parallel
  CI feature to speed up CI tasks. And we discuss the State of HTML Survey (and learn there's
  a lot more to HTML than just divs). A whole lot more."
