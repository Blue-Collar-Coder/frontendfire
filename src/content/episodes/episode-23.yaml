title: The Superglue Framework, Svelte 5’s Arrival, and OpenAI’s NY Times Legal Battle
date: 2024-01-15
description:
  The tech scene is heating up with the release of Superglue, an experimental new framework from Johnny Ho and
  the team at Thoughtbot. Superglue combines the best of Rails with React and Redux,sending JSON props to the
  React Redux app and swapping page components while still keeping the Rails goodness of form helpers, tag
  helpers, cookie authentication, etc. We also touch on the preview of Svelte 5, which is set to bring in the
  hotly anticipated runes, and the legal drama OpenAI finds itself in as the New York Times brings a lawsuit
  against it for copyright infringement claiming OpenAI trained its AI models of NYT content. Finally, we wrap up
  the episode with the less controversial, and possibly more useful, Knip tool that helps detect unused code
  in your apps to keep them cleaner and more maintainable.
