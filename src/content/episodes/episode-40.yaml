title: Figmaâ€™s Code Connect, Next.js 14.2, and New APIs in Chrome 124

teaser: >
  ðŸŽ¨ Exciting news from Figma! Introducing Code Connect, a game-changer in design-to-code workflows. ðŸš€ Next.js's 14.2 release upgrades Turbopack to RC stage, and Chrome 124 brings powerful new APIs to the table! âœ¨
description: >
  The episode starts off with news about Figmaâ€™s new Code Connect feature. Code Connect is the bridge between a design systemâ€™s component code and Figma, so when viewing components in Figmaâ€™s Dev Mode, theyâ€™ll have the same real world code that the design system relies on, and Code Connect can also map properties from code to Figma, enabling dynamic and correct snippets. The catch? This sweet new feature is only available to users who are on Figmaâ€™s Organization and Enterprise plans.


  We continue the news with the release of Next.js 14.2, which has moved Nextâ€™s Turbopack (the speedier successor to Webpack) into the release candidate stage with 99.8% of integration tests passing, and all Next.js examples working with it. Other improvements include tree-shaking, optimized CSS, better caching, and improved readability of error messages and stack traces in local development.


  The Google Chrome team is back with new updates packed into Chrome v124. Thereâ€™s two new APIs for handling HTML when a declarative shadow DOM is included in the(primarily used for encapsulation and component-based development). A new websocket stream API designed to make it easier for web sockets to handle a large volume of incoming messages without getting overwhelmed. And the view transitions API gets two new helper functions as well: view transition momentum and document render blocking. After its breakout year last year, the view transitions API seems to have some unstoppable forward momentum.


  And to wrap it up, we have another newcomer to the JavaScript package management games: VLT. Thereâ€™s not a lot to share about VLT so far (thereâ€™s a waitlist sign up now for early access), but itâ€™s helmed by some folks who played key roles in the creation of npm, Node.js and the GitHub CLI, and backed by some very big names in the JS world. Itâ€™s early days yet, but weâ€™ll keep you posted as more details around VLT emerge.
