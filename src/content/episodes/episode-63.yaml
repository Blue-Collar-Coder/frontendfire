teaser: >
  Deno 2 is here with better dependency management and CJS support, and updates to the CLI! ‚ú® Web Components go server side with the Declarative Shadow 
  DOM. üò± It‚Äôs a drama-fueled showdown between WordPress and WP Engine! Trademark disputes, cease and desist letters, and community uproar. Get your 
  popcorn ready, folks! üçø

  This episode kicks off with the new Deno 2 release candidate. Deno is an open source JavaScript runtime with native TypeScript support, a built-in 
  toolchain (think linters, code formatters, test runners, and more), and backwards compatible with Node.js and npm. Just one month prior Deno released 
  v1.46, and now v2 is out and better than ever. V2 boasts improved dependency management, updates to the APIs and CLI, and improved CommonJS support 
  because even though ESM is the future, so much good stuff in the JS ecosystem still runs on CJS. There‚Äôs a lot to be excited about in this new version 
  of Deno, and the team hopes users will let them know they think.


  Web Components take a big step forward in terms of wider spread adoption with the adoption of the Declarative Shadow DOM by all major browsers back in 
  August. The Shadow DOM (a Web Components standard) provides a way to scope CSS styles to a specific DOM subtree and isolate the subtree so the element 
  can be reused without fear of script conflicts or unexpected CSS cascades. But it only worked on the client side. The Declarative Shadow DOM removes 
  this limitation and now things like SSR, streaming data, and server rendering styles are possible. SSR has always been a sticking point for the adoption 
  of Web Components, but now it doesn‚Äôt have to be. Here‚Äôs to WC‚Äôs best year yet.


  Because the web development world can never be without some good drama going down, we now present for your viewing pleasure: the drama between WordPress 
  and WP Engine. Earlier in the week, Matt Mullenweg, creator of open source CMS WordPress and CEO of WordPress hosting company Automattic, took aim at 
  competitor company WP Engine, and essentially tried to drag WP Engine through the mud saying it should pay a significant amount of money for using the 
  WP trademark and that it doesn‚Äôt contribute enough back to the open source WP community. He did this at a WordPress conference, on X, and even posted it 
  on the WordPress.org site. WP Engine refused to cave to what seemed like blackmail and fired back with a cease and desist letter against Mullenweg and 
  Automattic. In response, Automattic sent its own cease and desist letter to WP Engine, and banned WP Engine from accessing the resource of WordPress.org. 
  To say that the WordPress community is worried and upset is an understatement, but we‚Äôll have to see how this plays out because it‚Äôs not over yet. 
  We‚Äôll keep you posted.


  In other news, three of OpenAI‚Äôs company leaders left after CEO Sam Altman called an ‚Äúabrupt‚Äù reorganization. The CTO, chief research officer, and VP of 
  post training all exited almost a year after the boardroom coup that temporarily ousted Altman. On its face everyone says the decisions to leave were 
  amicable, but only time will tell if that‚Äôs truly the case.


  And our Fire Starters portion of the show where we learn a bit more about a bit of less publicized HTML, CSS or JS info from around the web is about the 
  autocomplete attribute. Inspired by taking the State of HTML survey, the autocomplete attribute lets developers specify what if any permission the user 
  agent has to provide automated assistance in filling out form field values. Think things like ‚Äúgiven-name‚Äù or ‚Äúfamily-name‚Äù for a form with first name 
  and last name inputs or ‚Äúshipping street-address‚Äù for an address input. There are some nifty values that can be applied to forms, inputs, selects, and 
  textareas, and we guarantee it will make for a better user experience in the end.
