  Brace yourselves React fans! ⚛️✨ In this special interview Aiden Bai and Tobiloba Adedeji unveil
  Million.js v3, promising turbocharged performance. Get ready to supercharge your apps! 🚀
description: >
  Aiden Bai and Tobiloba Adedeji join us on the podcast to talk about the latest
  release of Million.js - a virtual DOM replacement for React projects that can
  make them run up to 70% faster.


  Born out of a desire to speed up data-heavy React UIs, Million 3 improves on the
  performance even more with a new hydration system that only traverses parts of the
  component that are dynamic, completely rewrote the compiler to offer better TS support,
  multiple returns, conditional support, etc., and updated the docs with a new i18n system,
  so they're available in multiple languages.


  Aiden and Tobiloba share their experiences working on the project, what the future might
  hold for Million.js, and how you can get involved in the Million.js community.
