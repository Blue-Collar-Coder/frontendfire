title: Signals in JS, RSCs in Storybook 8, and Bun Hits Windows in v1.1
date: 2024-04-08
teaser: >
  🌟 Exciting news for JavaScript devs! TC39 considers adding signals to the
  native JS ecosystem, StoryBook 8 has experimental support for RSCs, and JS
  runtime Bun v1.1 is now compatible with Windows 🍞.
description: >
  Signals have been around in the JavaScript world as early as 2010 when Knockout.js
  first introduced them, but the past few years they’ve been picking up steam among JS
  frameworks as a way to effectively manage application state so that developers can focus
  on the business logic parts of their apps. Now there’s a proposal to make Signals part
  of the native JavaScript ecosystem, and it’s being backed by some well-known frameworks
  like Angular, Svelte, Vue, and more.


  Storybook 8 has introduced experimental support for React Server Components. It is noted
  that server side actions are still only available in Next.js, but it’s great to see
  RSCs continuing to gain more traction in the world.


  Bun reached v1.1 recently, and while this isn’t usually a big milestone, for Bun it is,
  because it now supports Windows (and boasts impressive speeds for performance test metrics
  we’ve come to expect from JS runtimes) and offers a slew of improved Node.js compatibilities.
  As Bun says itself, it aims to be a drop-in replacement for Node, and if it keeps adding
  features, support, and speed gains like this, it very well might win that battle.


  Finally, the discussion wraps up with some smaller news stories like Angular and Wiz
  officially announcing they’ll become one, a lesser known Redux hook that can stand in
  for complicated useEffect calls, and a crazy, years-long Linux hack that almost made
  it into the major Linux distributions before it was caught.
