  Friend of the podcast (and previous guest host), Jason Lengstorf, joins Jack and Paige today to talk 
  about the latest happenings in the web dev world - and wax poetic at the end about favorite restaurants 
  and fine dining.


  First up, is AI model runner ONNX, which Jack’s been digging into recently. ONNX offers many pre-trained 
  models which can run locally or in the browser and integrates well with many different programming languages. 
  It leads to a more general discussion around vector databases, offline approaches to LLMs to protect user 
  privacy, and how Jack will be giving a talk on this very topic at the upcoming Chain React Conf in Portland.


  After that is new Lodash library competitor es-toolkit. It’s smaller, faster, relies heavily on native browser 
  APIs, and wants to supplant Lodash for all those useful helper functions so many JS apps still rely heavily on. 
  Favorite linting tool, ESLint, has also shared a post outlining its future plans. Think: a core rewrite which 
  will include a new npm package, ESM support, a composable API, a new CLI, and more. No dates have been set yet, 
  but the team’s got an ambitious project ahead of them.


  There’s a new React project framework named react-server that claims to be the easiest way to build React apps 
  with server-side rendering. It’s a refreshingly simple way to get started with a React project that uses RSCs 
  without using Next.js, and definitely worth a look for those smaller side projects devs like to spin up.


  Finally, Jason shares his experience with full stack JavaScript SDK Vinxi, which makes it easy for devs to build 
  JavaScript apps and even frameworks. It’s powered by Vite, Nitro, and Rollup, and provides a collection of primitives 
  that allow users to compose their own full stack apps and frameworks be they static sites, SPAs, APIs, or SSR-driven. 
  The sky’s the limit, and while documentation on the site is still a little slim, it shows lots of potential and a 
  small shallow learning curve.
